/**
 * Serves the `agent/acp` notification by piping one host frame into the CLI verbatim.
 *
 * The frame's payload is never parsed. ACP carries its own ids, ordering, and cancellation, so
 * anything this plugin decided about a payload would only be a second, weaker copy of what the
 * two ACP peers already agreed on. `effects` only reads `method` and `id` off the envelope, to
 * hold a new turn behind the Skill Effect barrier when one is engaged; see {@link SkillEffectCoordinator}.
 *
 * A frame that arrives while the CLI is down is dropped with a warning rather than throwing:
 * notifications have no response channel, so the host would never see the error, and failing the
 * handler cannot recover the frame either.
