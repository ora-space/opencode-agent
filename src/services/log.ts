 * Process-wide access to the plugin's structured logger.
 *
 * The SDK owns one logger per `Plugin` instance, and that instance only exists once
 * `runAgentPlugin` has built it — later than the class fields of the plugin and the module-level
 * helpers that want to log. This module bridges the gap: until `installLogger` runs, records go
 * to stderr through the SDK's own sink and envelope, so nothing said during construction is lost
 * or lands on stdout; afterwards every record — including those from a logger a module created
 * before the install — is written through the SDK's logger, because `logger(...)` resolves its
 * parent on each call rather than binding it once.
 *
 * Targets name the component a record came from (`plugin`, `opencode-client`, `effects`, ...) so
 * a filtered view of `plugin.log` can follow one of them; the host stamps identity and generation.
